# pytest.ini
#
# This configuration adds the current directory to the Python path when running tests.
# This is needed to resolve the absolute imports in test files (e.g., "from tests.integration.base import...")
# Without this setting, pytest fails to find the "tests" module when running in CI environments.
#
# Note: When running tests with unittest, you may need to set PYTHONPATH manually:
# PYTHONPATH=. python -m unittest discover tests/integration/
