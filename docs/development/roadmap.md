## Contributing to the Roadmap

We welcome community input on the GigQ roadmap. If you have ideas or would like to contribute to any of these initiatives:

1. **Open an Issue**: Share your ideas by opening an issue on our GitHub repository
2. **Start a Discussion**: Join our discussions about future features
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Implement a feature and submit a pull request
4. **Provide Feedback**: Tell us about your use cases and what features would be most valuable

When suggesting new features, please consider:

- How the feature aligns with GigQ's philosophy of simplicity and reliability
- The target audience for the feature
- Potential implementation challenges
- How the feature would be tested

## Release Planning

We follow semantic versioning:

- **Major version** (x.0.0): Incompatible API changes
- **Minor version** (0.x.0): Backwards-compatible new features
- **Patch version** (0.0.x): Backwards-compatible bug fixes

## Experimental Features

Some features may be introduced as experimental before being officially supported:

- [ ] Graph-based workflow representation
- [ ] Specialized job types for common tasks

Experimental features will be clearly marked and may change or be removed in future releases.

## Deprecation Policy

As GigQ evolves, some features may need to be deprecated:

1. Features will be marked as deprecated but will continue to function
2. Deprecation warnings will be issued when using deprecated features
3. Deprecated features will be removed after at least two minor versions
4. Documentation will provide migration guidance
